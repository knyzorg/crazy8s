# Crazy 8s Assignment

As much as I wanted to implement and "help" modal, I already went too far out of scope for this assignment and working in a virtual DOM is getting annoying.

The game is fairly intuitive to use apart from 2 points which I would care to clarify as they are indeed part of the assignment.

1) The user information extracted from the query string is placed in a box that is invisible by default. To reveal it, click on the underlined "Human" text on the top bar and it will appear in the upper-left corner.

2) Forcing the user to play, or rather to _not_ pick a card seemed forceful and unfun. As such, drawing a card is possible at every turn and done so by clicking on the face-down deck.
